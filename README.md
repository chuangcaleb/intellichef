## About <a name = "about"></a>

A coursework assignment for the COMP3004 Designing Intelligent Agents module.

Intelligent agents must cooperate together to maximize population within a time frame. One new unit is introduced for each house built; a house takes time to build, and requires Wood and Stone, which can be gathered.

The catch is that agents get progressively more skilled and efficient in a task that they repeat, so they should tend to specialize in the same tasks. However, agents will 'die' of old age after enough game cycles!
<!-- Should they also simply grow inefficient as they age? -->

The study would be on how the score and strategies vary according to the skewing of resource efficiency (i.e. 2 wood 8 stone for one house, a faster skill rate for wood than stone, etc.). It's assumed that one resource would have more skilled agents, but perhaps at the same skill level.

OR

The study would be on how the average skill level varies according to max number of cycles. As cycles increase, there should be more skilled workers.

OR

The agents have a base modifier for each skill â€” some get more skilled at faster rates than others! This will

OR

Building a house requires 2+ agents

<!-- After working, some agents will also need to rest. -->
